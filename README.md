# js-script

This sample Javascript is able to select the sum of combinations (starting from 2 members to n) of unique elements from an array with duplicate values.
For example array ["yellow","yellow","red","green"] the code must return 4 because there are ["yellow","red"], ["yellow","green"], ["red","green"], ["yellow","red","green"] results. The sum then the number of arrays which is  - in our example - 4.
